# Half Suit Online Card Game

A strategic team-based card game for six players (two teams of three) played online via a web interface. Built with FastAPI backend and React frontend.

## Game Overview

Half Suit is a deduction-based card game where teams compete to claim "half suits" by correctly identifying where all cards in a suit are located. The game features:

- **6 players** in **2 teams** of 3 each
- **9 half suits** to claim (standard suits split 2-7 and 9-A, plus 8s+Jokers)
- **Strategic claiming** with counter-claims and tactical "claiming for the other team"
- **Real-time multiplayer** with WebSocket synchronization

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker (optional)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd half-suit-game
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Or use Docker**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Game Rules

### Basic Gameplay

1. **Setup**: 6 players are randomly assigned to 2 teams of 3
2. **Cards**: Standard 52-card deck + 2 jokers, dealt 9 cards each
3. **Half Suits**: 9 half suits of 6 cards each:
   - 2-7 of each suit (4 half suits)
   - 9-A of each suit (4 half suits)  
   - All 8s + 2 jokers (1 half suit)

### Actions

- **Ask**: Request a specific card from an opponent
  - Must have at least one card of that half suit
  - If successful, continue your turn
  - If unsuccessful, turn passes to other team

- **Claim**: Declare where all 6 cards of a half suit are located
  - **Own team has all cards**: Immediate resolution (correct = point)
  - **Other team has all cards**: Other team makes counter-claim
  - **Cards split**: 
    - Regular claim = automatic failure
    - "Claim for other team" = specify other team's cards

### Winning

- Game ends when all 9 half suits are claimed
- Team with most points (5+ out of 9) wins

## API Endpoints

### REST API
