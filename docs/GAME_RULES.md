## Game Overview

Half Suit is a strategic team-based card game for exactly **6 players** divided into **2 teams of 3 players each**. The game combines elements of deduction, memory, and tactical decision-making as teams compete to claim "half suits" by correctly identifying where specific cards are located.

**Objective:** Score the most points by successfully claiming half suits before your opponents do.

**Game Duration:** 15-30 minutes

**Ages:** 12+

## Setup

### Player Assignment
- 6 players are randomly assigned to two teams (Team A and Team B)
- Each team has exactly 3 players
- Players only know their own cards but can see all game history

### Initial Deal
- Each player receives exactly **9 cards** from the shuffled deck
- All cards are dealt; no cards remain in a central pile
- Players may examine their own cards but must keep them hidden from others

## Game Components

### Deck Composition
The game uses a modified standard deck consisting of **54 cards**:
- Standard 52-card deck
- Plus 2 Jokers
- **Total: 54 cards**

### Half Suits
The deck is conceptually divided into **9 half suits**, each containing exactly **6 cards**:

1. **Low Spades:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of Spades
2. **High Spades:** 9, 10, J, Q, K, A of Spades

9. **Eights and Jokers:** 8♠, 8♥, 8♦, 8♣, Joker, Joker

*Note: The 8s are deliberately excluded from the regular suits to create the special "Eights and Jokers" half suit.*

## Gameplay

### Turn Structure
- **Teams alternate turns** (Team A, then Team B, then Team A, etc.)
- **First turn** is given to a randomly selected team and player
- On each turn, **one player from the active team** takes an action
- **Team chooses** which of their players takes the turn (if multiple players are eligible)

### Player Eligibility
- **To ASK:** Player must have at least 1 card in hand
- **To CLAIM:** Any player can claim, even with 0 cards in hand
- **When a player's hand is emptied** (by giving away cards), their team chooses a new player with cards for future turns

### Turn Continuation
- **After a successful ASK:** The same team continues their turn
- **After a failed ASK:** Turn passes to the opposing team
- **After any CLAIM:** Turn passes to the opposing team (regardless of claim outcome)

## Actions

On your turn, you may choose one of two actions:

### 1. ASK for a Card

**Requirements:**
- You must have at least 1 card in your hand
- You must hold at least 1 card from the same half suit as the card you're asking for
- You must ask a player from the opposing team

**Process:**
1. Choose an opponent from the other team
2. Ask for a specific card (e.g., "Do you have the 5 of Hearts?")
3. The opponent must truthfully respond

**Outcomes:**
- **Success:** If they have the card, they give it to you, and your team continues
- **Failure:** If they don't have the card, your turn ends and play passes to the other team

**Important Notes:**
- All asks are **public information** - everyone knows who asked whom for what card and the result
- You cannot ask for a card if you don't hold any cards from that half suit
- You cannot ask teammates for cards

### 2. CLAIM a Half Suit

**Requirements:**
- The half suit must not already be claimed/out of play
- You must specify exactly which player holds each of the 6 cards in the half suit

**Process:**
1. Choose an unclaimed half suit
2. Assign each of the 6 cards to specific players (including yourself and teammates)
3. The claim is evaluated immediately

## Claiming Rules

Claims are the heart of the game's strategy. The outcome depends on how the 6 cards are distributed between teams:

### Scenario 1: All Cards with Your Team

**What happens:**
- Your claim is evaluated immediately
- **If correct:** Your team gets 1 point, cards are discarded
- **If incorrect:** The opposing team gets 1 point, cards are discarded

### Scenario 2: All Cards with Opposing Team

**What happens:**
1. Your claim **pauses** - it's not evaluated yet
2. The opposing team must **immediately nominate one player** to make a counter-claim
3. The nominated player must specify which of their teammates holds each card
4. **If counter-claim is correct:** Opposing team gets 1 point
5. **If counter-claim is incorrect:** Your team gets 1 point
6. Cards are discarded either way

### Scenario 3: Cards Split Between Teams

You have **two options** when making your claim:

#### Option A: Regular Claim
- You assign cards to players from both teams
- **Result:** Your claim is automatically incorrect (cards split = automatic failure)
- **Outcome:** Opposing team gets 1 point, cards are discarded

#### Option B: "Claim for the Other Team"
- You explicitly state you're claiming for the other team
- You assign all 6 cards to opposing team members only
- **If correct:** Your team gets 1 point
- **If incorrect:** Opposing team gets 1 point
- Cards are discarded either way

### Important Claiming Rules

- **Each half suit can only be claimed once** - after any claim (right or wrong), those cards are permanently out of play
- **All claims are public** - everyone sees your assignments and the results
- **No take-backs** - once you make a claim, it must be resolved
- **Claims always end your turn** - regardless of outcome, play passes to the other team

## Winning

### Game End
The game ends when **all 9 half suits have been claimed** (correctly or incorrectly).

### Scoring
- Each successful claim awards **1 point** to the claiming team
- There are exactly **9 points** available (one per half suit)
- The team with the **most points wins**

### Tie-Breaking
- **Ties are impossible** - with 9 total points, one team will always have at least 5 points
- The game guarantees a winner

## Strategy Tips

### For Beginners

1. **Track public information carefully**
   - Remember all successful and failed asks
   - Note who has been giving and receiving cards
   - Keep mental notes of card counts

2. **Ask strategically**
   - Don't reveal your hand composition too early
   - Ask for cards you actually need
   - Consider what information your ask reveals

3. **Claim conservatively at first**
   - Start with half suits you're very confident about
   - Remember that wrong claims give points to opponents

### For Advanced Players

1. **Use "claim for other team" tactically**
   - This can be powerful when you're confident about opponent holdings
   - It's often safer than regular claims when cards are split

2. **Control information flow**
   - Sometimes make asks that don't reveal much about your hand
   - Consider asking for cards you don't actually want to mislead opponents

3. **Team coordination**
   - Share information through your asking patterns
   - Coordinate who takes turns strategically
   - Consider emptying a player's hand to give team more flexibility

4. **Endgame planning**
   - Track which half suits are most valuable to claim
   - Consider the score when deciding between safe and risky claims
   - Sometimes force opponents into difficult counter-claim situations

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Ask

**Situation:** It's your turn, you have the 2♠ and 3♠ in your hand.

**Action:** You ask Player B (opponent): "Do you have the 4 of Spades?"

**Outcomes:**
- **If Player B has 4♠:** They give it to you, you continue your turn
- **If Player B doesn't have 4♠:** Your turn ends, other team's turn begins

### Example 2: Successful Claim

**Situation:** You believe your team holds all cards in the Low Hearts half suit.

**Action:** You claim Low Hearts, assigning:
- 2♥ → You
- 3♥ → Teammate A  
- 4♥ → Teammate B
- 5♥ → You
- 6♥ → Teammate A
- 7♥ → Teammate B

**Outcome:** If correct, your team gets 1 point. If incorrect, opponents get 1 point.

### Example 3: Counter-Claim Situation

**Situation:** Opponent claims High Spades, but you know your team has all those cards.

**What happens:**
1. Opponent's claim pauses (not evaluated yet)
2. Your team must nominate someone to counter-claim
3. Nominated player assigns all 6 cards to your team members
4. If counter-claim is correct, your team gets the point
5. If counter-claim is wrong, opponent's team gets the point

### Example 4: Claim for Other Team

**Situation:** You're confident the opponents hold all the Eights and Jokers.

**Action:** You explicitly "claim for the other team," assigning:
- 8♠ → Opponent A
- 8♥ → Opponent B  
- 8♦ → Opponent C
- 8♣ → Opponent A
- Joker → Opponent B
- Joker → Opponent C

**Outcome:** If correct, your team gets 1 point. If incorrect, their team gets 1 point.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I ask for a card I already have?
**A:** No, you must hold at least one card from the half suit to ask for any card from that half suit, but you cannot ask for a specific card you already possess.

### Q: What happens if I run out of cards?
**A:** You can no longer ask for cards, but you can still make claims. Your team will choose a different player with cards for future asking turns.

### Q: Can I discuss strategy with my teammates?
**A:** No, there is no private communication allowed. All communication must be through the public actions of asking and claiming.

### Q: What if I make a claim and realize I made a mistake?
**A:** Claims cannot be taken back once made. The claim will be evaluated as stated.

### Q: Can I claim a half suit that's already been claimed?
**A:** No, once a half suit has been claimed (correctly or incorrectly), it's permanently out of play.

### Q: How do I know which cards are in each half suit?
**A:** The game interface will show you the half suit definitions. Remember, 8s are separate from their regular suits and paired with Jokers.

### Q: What's the best strategy for beginners?
**A:** Focus on gathering information through asks, keep track of all public information, and make conservative claims only when you're very confident.

### Q: Can the same player take multiple consecutive turns?
**A:** Yes, if they keep making successful asks, they can continue taking turns for their team.

### Q: What happens in a counter-claim situation if the nominated player doesn't want to counter-claim?

### Q: Is there a time limit for actions?
**A:** In online play, there may be reasonable time limits to keep the game moving, but the rules don't specify exact times.
